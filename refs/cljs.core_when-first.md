(__when-first__ bindings & body)<br>
</samp>

---

With `bindings` as `x`, `xs`, roughly the same as `(when (seq xs) (let [x (first
xs)] body))` but `xs` is evaluated only once.

---



Source docstring:

```
bindings => x xs

Same as (when (seq xs) (let [x (first xs)] body))
```

Source code:

```clj
(defmacro when-first
  [bindings & body]
  (assert-args when-first
     (vector? bindings) "a vector for its binding"
     (= 2 (count bindings)) "exactly 2 forms in binding vector")
  (let [[x xs] bindings]
    `(when (seq ~xs)
       (let [~x (first ~xs)]
         ~@body))))
```

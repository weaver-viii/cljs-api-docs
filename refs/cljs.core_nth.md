Returns the value at index `n` or `not-found` if the index is out of bounds.

`nth` will throw an exception if `n` is out of bounds and `not-found` is not
supplied.

`nth` works for Strings, Arrays, Regex Matchers, Lists, and Sequences. For
Sequences, `nth` takes O(n) time.

Source docstring:

```
Returns the value at the index. get returns nil if index out of
bounds, nth throws an exception unless not-found is supplied.  nth
also works for strings, arrays, regex Matchers and Lists, and,
in O(n) time, for sequences.
```

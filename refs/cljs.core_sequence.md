Source docstring:

```
Coerces coll to a (possibly empty) sequence, if it is not already
one. Will not force a lazy seq. (sequence nil) yields (), When a
transducer is supplied, returns a lazy sequence of applications of
the transform to the items in coll(s), i.e. to the set of first
items of each coll, followed by the set of second
items in each coll, until any one of the colls is exhausted.  Any
remaining items in other colls are ignored. The transform should accept
number-of-colls arguments
```

Source code:

```clj
(defn sequence
  ([coll]
     (if (seq? coll)
       coll
       (or (seq coll) ())))
  ([xform coll]
     (.create LazyTransformer xform coll))
  ([xform coll & colls]
     (.createMulti LazyTransformer xform (to-array (cons coll colls)))))

Source docstring:

```
The old IPrintable protocol's implementation consisted of building a giant
   list of strings to concatenate.  This involved lots of concat calls,
   intermediate vectors, and lazy-seqs, and was very slow in some older JS
   engines.  IPrintWithWriter implements printing via the IWriter protocol, so it
   be implemented efficiently in terms of e.g. a StringBuffer append.

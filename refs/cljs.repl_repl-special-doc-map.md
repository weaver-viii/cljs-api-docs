```clj
(def repl-special-doc-map
  '{in-ns {:arglists ([name])
           :doc "Sets *cljs-ns* to the namespace named by the symbol, creating it if needed."}
    require {:arglists ([& args])
             :doc "  Loads libs, skipping any that are already loaded. Each argument is
  either a libspec that identifies a lib or a flag that modifies how all the identified
  libs are loaded. Use :require in the ns macro in preference to calling this
  directly.

  Libs

  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define a
  library of ClojureScript code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated
  with a ClojureScript namespace. A lib's name also locates its root directory
  within classpath using Java's package name to classpath-relative path mapping.
  All resources in a lib should be contained in the directory structure under its
  root directory. All definitions a lib makes should be in its associated namespace.

  'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path
  is derived from the lib name in the following manner:
  Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory
  <classpath>/x/y/, and its root resource is <classpath>/x/y/z.clj. The root
  resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace (usually by using
  the ns macro) and load any additional lib resources.

  Libspecs

  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by
  options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.

  Recognized options:
  :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the
    lib's namespace in the current namespace.
  :refer takes a list of symbols to refer from the namespace..
  :refer-macros takes a list of macro symbols to refer from the namespace.
  :include-macros takes a list of macro symbols to refer from the namespace.

  Flags

  A flag is a keyword.
  Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose
  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are
    already loaded
  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the
    identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use
  :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer

  Example:

  The following would load the library clojure.string :as string.

  (require '[clojure/string :as string])"}
    require-macros {:arglists ([& args])
                    :doc "Similar to the require REPL special function but
    only for macros."}
    import {:arglists ([& import-symbols-or-lists])
            :doc "import-list => (closure-namespace constructor-name-symbols*)

  For each name in constructor-name-symbols, adds a mapping from name to the
  constructor named by closure-namespace to the current namespace. Use :import in the ns
  macro in preference to calling this directly."}
    load-file {:arglist ([name])
               :doc "Sequentially read and evaluate the set of forms contained in the file."}})
